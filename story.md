# The Code Chronicles

## Part 1
In the bustling city of Techville, a group of developers worked tirelessly on a groundbreaking project. Among them was Alex, a meticulous coder who believed in the power of organization. One day, while sifting through lines of code, Alex stumbled upon a critical bug. Panic set in, but then Alex remembered the team's use of Git version control. With a few commands, Alex was able to revert to a previous commit, isolating the bug and fixing it without disrupting the entire project.
